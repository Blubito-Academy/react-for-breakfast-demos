# Responsive design

## Key discussion points: 
- Responsive images and fonts
- Media queries
- Responsive flex and grid layouts
- Testing our layout 

## Tipps :
- Avoid fixed sizes (like heights/widths of containers) 
- If we need to have some form of a fixed size -> use min-/max- properties
- Let the browser do most of the work
- Utilize relative units (such as rem and em)
- Don't abuse media queries
